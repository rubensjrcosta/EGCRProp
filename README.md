**EGCRProp**<a name="cite_ref-1"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) a is a Monte Carlo code written in C ++ for the propagation of Ultra-High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) through Extragalactic Magnetic Fields (EMFs). In the simulation, it is
calculated the three-dimensional trajectory of nuclei (from proton to iron) through unitary cells of
coherent magnetic fields, as well as the particleâ€™s dynamic parameters: the trajectory radius or the
traveled distance, the energy, and the deflection angle, are recorded after each event to be further
analyzed.

#### The parameters input description:

P_spec 				= particle species (1 proton; 2 helium; 3 oxygen; 4 silicon; 5 iron) <br>
E_EeV 				= the particle's energy in EeV <br>
D_Mpc 				= the distance in Mpc <br>
E_loss				= the energy losses (0 off; 1 on) <br>
MF_model 			= magnetic field model (1 Cellular Structure,2 Cubic Domain, 3 Uniform Magnetic Field) <br>
B_nG				= magnetic field strength in nG <br>
l_coh 				= coherence length in Mpc <br>
s_depth 			= the skin depth in % of coherence length <br>
n_cells  			= the number of nearby cells to be considered <br>
b_track 			= backtracking (0 off; 1 on) !!!backtracking off works only for the stopping distance mode 1 <br>
d_stop 				= stopping distance (1 cut in distance traveled; 2 cut in trajectory radius) <br>
m_rigidity 			= magnetic rigidity (0 off; 1 on) <br>
N_evts 				= number of launched particles <br>
N_traj 				= number of plotted trajectories <br> 
i_method 			= equation of motion integration (1 Runge-Kutta 4th, 2 Boris, 3 Vay*, 4 New Euler<a name="cite_ref-2"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2)) <br>
t_scal 				= time scale <br>
r_dist				= random distribution (1 uniform, 2 gaussian, with the parameter sigma=1) <br>
r_seed 				= random seed (0 based on time, 1 fixed (123 as default, mySeed (line 17, file MPFRGSLvariables.h)) <br>
